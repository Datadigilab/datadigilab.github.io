(ii) Prove that there are infinitely many rational good pairs.<br>
</p>

<p>
<b>B6.</b> Let \(p\) denote a prime number in this question.<br>
(i) Show that \(x^2+x-1\) has at most two roots \( \pmod{p} \). In other words show that the cardinality of the set \(S\) (defined below) is at most two.
\[ S = \{ n\in \mathbb{N} |  \;\;\; 1\leq n \leq p, \;\; s.t. \;\;\; p|n^2+n-1  \}  \]

## Examination pattern update
As in recent years, the exam is being conducted using the TCS iON platform. For security reasons, the question paper will be distributed in electronic form to all centres. Each candidate will be seated at a separate computer and will be able to read the questions on the screen.

In all the exams, Part A consists of objective questions that have to be answered directly on the computer.

An answer booklet will be provided to write your answers on paper for the remaining parts, as usual.

The format of each type of answer booklet is given below. Designated space is provided for each answer. There are blank sheets for rough work at the end. Please familiarize yourself with the format of the answer booklet for the exam you are going to write.

[BSc exam answer booklet, 22 May](CMI-2022-BSc-answer-booklet-22may2022.pdf)

- This year the subjective part will have 6 question worth 80 points.
- The timing of the paper is increased by half an hour.

## CMI entrance exam cutoff

The cutoff has been around 40% for the objective section and 40-50% overall. The objective section is used for screening.<br>

CMI does not publish the cutoff marks but they have responded to individual requests in the past. The scores shown below were shared by former students who were privy to this data.
<br>

### 2021 cutoff marks

In 2021, CMI used an unconventional criteria for admission. The cut-off for  Part A was 17/40 for everyone. More weightage was given to Part B marks. In the general category with scholarship, students were admitted if they had >=61 marks in total or if they had 39 or more marks in Part B. So, a student who got 17 marks in Part A and 39 marks in Part B was still admitted with scholarship. But a student with 22 marks in Part A and 38 marks in Part B was NOT admitted in that category.


Type | General |  Reserved
-----|------|----
With scholarship| 61/100 or 39/60 in Part B | 57/100 or 35/60 in Part B
Without scholarship| 56/100 or 30/60 in Part B | 50/100 or 28/60 in Part B


There was no waiting list.

### 2020 cutoff marks

The cutoff marks for the year 2020 are given below. The marks are out of 94 instead of 100 since one question had a mistake.

Type | General |  Reserved
-----|------|----
With scholarship| 54/94 | 44/94
Without scholarship| 48/94 | 40/94
Waiting list| 45/94 | 38/94

### Previous year cutoffs

The cutoff marks for the previous years are given below.

| Year | Objective (40 marks) | Overall |
|---|--|--|
2016 | 14 | 62/124 |
2017 | 15 | 60/125 |
2018 | 15 | 50/125 |
2019 | 16 | 52/100 |
2020 | 16 | 48/94  |
2021 | 17 | 56/100  |

## Admission rate

Acceptance offers are sent to around 90 candidates and about half of them enroll. This is the reason why the number varies from year to year. Approximate numbers are given below.

| Year | # Test-takers | # Offers | # Students enrolled
|-----|----|--|
2015 | 4000 | 70 | 40
2016 | 4000 | 90 | 44
2017 | 4000 | 90 | 45
2018 | 5000 | 95 | 48
2019 | 5500 | 100 | 61
